<p class="building"> The Hagfors Center for Science, Business, and Religion is our
   newest building on campus. It was completed in the January of 2018. Here is
   where most of our STEM majors will have a majority of their classes. It houses
   the Biology, Business, Chemistry, Computer Science, Physics, Psychology, Math,
   and Religion departments. There is a chapel on the third floor, a greenhouse on the
   fourth floor, a cafe on the second floor, and a plethora of classes and lab spaces.
   Each department has their own common area for students to study, or hangout. Hagfors
   is connected to the Lindell Library via skyway.

<!-- <p class="building"> The interdisciplinary Hagfors Center is designed to foster
   intersections among areas of study, support active learning, and connect the University to the community. As such, the new
   building embodies Augsburgâ€™s commitment to student learning, urban placemaking, and thoughtful stewardship.
   By offering students this new building, they now have access to more classrooms/labs, up to date equipment,
   and programs such as NorthStar STEM, URGO, etc.</p> -->
